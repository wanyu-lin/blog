「Sleepyhead」is a song that I am very fond of. 

It is from Galen Crew's 「Acoustic Daydreams」released in 2012.



In the year of our lord twelve thirty nine

There once lived a girl of a royal line

The ancient stories do recall

She was the fairest of them all

In a castle made of stone

Every night she slept alone

Any noise that would raise the dead

Couldn't wake her sleepyhead

A stranger came from a foreign land

Asking for the maiden's hand

Her father said no, go away

She's gonna marry a king one day

The stranger he came back again

Riding with ten thousand men

Their battle cries filled all with dread

But couldn't wake her sleepyhead

The fighting lasted all day long

But the castle walls were thick and strong

The stranger cried let her decide

Where her true affections lie

So the king knocked on her door

Only you can end this war

No one knows how the story ends

Did she ever wake again?

Will she ever wake again?
